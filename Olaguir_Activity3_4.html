[Verse 1]
                       Bm
I took an arrow to the heart
                            G
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
                 D
Strawberries and somethin' more
                        A
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
                  Bm
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
                           G
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
                D
Go dancing underneath the stars
                     A
Ooh, yeah, I want it all, mmm
 
Yeah, you got me feeling like

[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
 I wanna be that guy
 
I wanna kiss your eyes
G
 I wanna drink that smile
 
I wanna feel like I'm
D
 Like my soul's on fire
                    A
I wanna stay up all day and all night
 
Yeah, you got me singing like
 
 
[Chorus]
Bm
Ooh, I love when you do it like that
                G
And when you're close up, you give me thе shivers
        D
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
              A
And whеn they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
              Bm
And we'll say ooh I love it when you do it like that
                G
And when you're close up, you give me the shivers
        D
Oh baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
              A
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back
 
 
[Verse 2]
         Bm                           G
Into the car, on the back seat in the moon lit dark
                        D
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
                  A
Ooh, I can't get enough
                            Bm
You know you could tear me apart
                         G
Put me back together and take my heart
                             D
I never thought that I could love this hard
                  A
Ooh, I can't get enough
 
Mmm, you got me feeling like
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm
 I wanna be that guy
 
I wanna kiss your eyes
G
 I wanna drink that smile
 
I wanna feel like I'm

Yeah, you got me singing like

[Bridge]
      Bm
Baby, you burn so hot you make me shiver
         G
With the fire you got, this thing is started
        D                                     A
I don't want it to stop, you know you make me shiver, er, er
      Bm
Baby, you burn so hot you make me shiver
         G
With the fire you got, this thing is started
